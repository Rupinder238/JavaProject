This crossword game is one of my first game made in school. It uses Java, JavaFx and has fixed questions because of no database used in it.
When you run the game it prompt you for your name and that name is displayed when you play the game along with the score. It also have a timmer so you can see how fast you completed the game.
Grid is made using a 2-d array, for loop and using the labels to make it easier.
You can type the answer in the box and if it is correct it will put it in the grid and increase your score.
You can end the game in-between or just press solve me button to just end the game.
On the final window it will display you score and name.
